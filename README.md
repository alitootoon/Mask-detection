# Mask detection
 real time face mask detection using python and Cnn
## Getting Started
 These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
 ### requirements
 * Python 3.8
 * Tensorflow
 * Keras
* Sklearn
 * Numpy
 * Cv2
 ### Running and Testing
 First you need to Install all the pachages that I menstioned in requirements section. Download the Dataset and set the direction in train.py. 
 run train.py to train your model first. I used google Colab for higher performance. when trainning is done you have the trinning model results that you should use for testing. set the model direction in test.py then run the script. a live camera caputre will open and you see the results
